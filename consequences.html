          <h5>Immunity Gaps</h5>
          <p>occur when babies do not get protective antibodies against diphtheria, whooping cough, polio, tetanus, hepatitis B, and other diseases from their mothers. Children are given shots at a young age because this is when they are at highest
            risk of getting sick or dying if they get these diseases; it’s important to immunize a child before she or he is exposed to them.</p>

          <h5>Vaccine Hesitancy</h5>
          <p>threatens to reverse progress made in tackling vaccine-preventable diseases. Currently, vaccination prevents 2-3 million deaths a year, and a further 1.5 million could be avoided if global coverage of vaccinations improved. Measles, for
            example, has seen a 30% increase in cases globally. The reasons for this rise are complex, and not all of these cases are due to vaccine hesitancy. However, some countries that were close to eliminating the disease have seen a resurgence.

          <h5>Improper Exemptions</h5>
          <p>are a growing menace to herd immunity. According to the 2015 National Immunization Survey, only 72.2% of children aged 19 to 35 months in the United States were fully vaccinated as per guidelines from the Advisory Committee on
            Immunization Practices. Due to parental concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy, many families choose to opt out their children from vaccinations required for school entry by obtaining nonmedical exemptions (NMEs) based on religious or
            philosophical beliefs. In 2016, 18 states permitted NMEs due to philosophical beliefs. A detailed analysis of NMEs within each of the 18 states reveals that several counties, including those with large metropolitan areas, are at high risk
            for vaccine-preventable pediatric infection epidemics.</p>

        <a href="https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2019/04/09/why-measles-parties-are-a-bad-idea-for-parents/">
          <h5>Measles Parties</h5>
          <p>are a method of self-immunization where parents expose unvaccinated children to kids already suffering with measles in order to intentionally infect the group at a young age. The practice has its own faulty logic based on how humans
            fight off the disease. The CDC says 9 out of 10 people who are exposed to someone with measles will become infected, though they might not know for up to six days. In a “measles party,” every child becomes a carrier out in the world,
            allowing the disease to find new carriers and continue to spread to vulnerable people – babies too young to get vaccinations and people with compromised immune systems.</p>
