<h3>Invention</h3>
  <section class="Hov">
<h5>Edward Jenner</h5>
<p>invented a method to protect against smallpox in 1796. The method involved taking material from a blister of someone infected with cowpox and inoculating it into another person’s skin; this was called arm-to-arm inoculation. However by the
late 1940s, scientific knowledge had developed enough, so that large-scale vaccine production was possible and disease control efforts could begin in earnest.</p>

        <h3>Trial and Error</h3>
        <section class="Hov">
      <h5>The Cutter Incident</h5>
      <p>1955 - some batches of polio vaccine given to the public contained live polio virus, even though they had passed required safety testing. At the time, there was no system in place to compensate people who might have been harmed by a
        vaccine. Today we have the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Programexternal icon (VICP), which uses scientific evidence to determine whether a vaccine might be the cause of an illness or injury, and provides compensation to individuals
        found to have been harmed by a vaccine.</p>

      <h5>Rotavirus Vaccine and Intussusception</h5>
      <p>1998 - shortly after it was licensed, some infants who had recieved the RotaShield vaccine developed intussusception (rare type of bowel obstruction that occurs when the bowel folds in on itself). The Advisory Committee on Immunization
        Practices (ACIP) withdrew its recommendation to immunize infants against rotavirus gastroenteritis using this vaccine, and the manufacturer voluntarily withdrew RotaShield from the market in October 1999. The ACIP comprises medical and
        public health experts who develop recommendations on the use of vaccines in the civilian population of the United States.</p>

  <h3>Major Successes</h3>

  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/polio/what-is-polio/polio-us.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fpolio%2Fus%2Findex.html">
  <h5>Polio</h5>
  <p>is a crippling and potentially deadly infectious disease that is caused by poliovirus.
    In the early 1950s, before polio vaccines were available, polio outbreaks caused more than 15,000 cases of paralysis each year in the United States.
    Following introduction of vaccines — specifically, trivalent inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) in 1955 and trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in 1963 — the number of polio cases fell rapidly to less than 100 in the 1960s and fewer
    than 10 in the 1970s.
    Since 1979, no cases of polio have originated in the United States.</p>

  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/about/index.html">
    <h5>Smallpox</h5>
    <p>was a serious infectious disease caused by the variola virus. Most people with smallpox recovered, but about 3 out of every 10 people with the disease died; survivors often have permanent scars over large areas of their body, especially
      their faces. Thanks to the success of vaccination, the last natural outbreak of smallpox in the United States occurred in 1949. In 1980, the World Health Assembly declared smallpox eradicated (eliminated), and no cases of naturally
      occurring smallpox have happened since.</p>
