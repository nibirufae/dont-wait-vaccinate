      <h3>The "Overload" Myth</h3>
      <section class="Hov">
        <h5>Scientific data</h5>
        <p>shows that getting several vaccines at the same time does not cause any chronic health problems. Sometimes, certain combinations of vaccines given together can cause fever, and occasionally febrile seizures; these are temporary and do not
          cause any lasting damage. Based on this information, both the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend getting all routine childhood vaccines on time.</p>

      <h3>The Autism Hoax</h3>
      <section class="Hov">
        <h5>Studies have shown</h5>
        <p>that there is no link between receiving vaccines and developing autism spectrum disorder (ASD). One vaccine ingredient that has been studied specifically is thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative used to prevent contamination of
          multidose vials of vaccines. Research shows that neither thimerosal nor other vaccine ingredients cause ASD.</p>
